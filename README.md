# Defect detection on roads

To try out this project, clone this repo and have the necessary python libraries installed. They are defined in the first cell of `generate_potential_defects.ipynb`.

To detect the defects on an image, call the highlight_defects function with the path to the image. Make sure to run all the previous cells in the notebook first.
